#Mission Control Graphics

This repository contains graphics resources for Mission Control, such as the Mission Control icon artwork, splashscreens and similar. These are binary files, so ensure that you really _have_ to create a new version of a file, and try to only submit when you are done editing it. These files are in a separate repo so that we can reset it when it grows too large. Don't expect revision history to be around forever in this repo.
